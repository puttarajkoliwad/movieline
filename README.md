## Solution approach. Inspired by the trending payment apps, I have used wallet system in my application to handle the booking payment. Since wallet payment is easy, fast and secure too. I have also been working on implementing other payment options for the project like credit cards & UPI and doing external research on the same.

1) Only admin users can add/update/delete new and theaters to the table.
2) When a new user signs up he gets a reward value of Rs 800 in his Movieline wallet.
3) The user will easily be able to book a movie just by one click. The ticket amount will be auto debited from his Movieline-wallet.
4) If the user cancels the ticket, the ticket amount will be credited back into his Movieline-wallet.
